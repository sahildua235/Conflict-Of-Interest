# Here's your WCP CLI scratchpad!

# Use this scratchpad to run WQL queries via CLI commands while you're coding your PMD endpoints.
# This scratchpad runs your CLI command as you're entering them, and shows these helpful output on the right:
#   - The WQL query.
#   - The PMD expression with the WQL query. You can copy this to your clipboard and paste it into your PMD code.
#   - The query output.
#
# As a start, use the example CLI commands to get the data source and fields you need in your WQL query.
#   - To get the data source to query from, uncomment the datasource command.
#        After this command executes, copy the id and alias of the data source you want to query.
#   - To get the fields to select, uncomment the fields command. Insert the id of the data source you want to query.
#        After this command executes, copy the alias of the fields you want to select.
#   - To run the query, uncomment the data command. Replace the fields and data source alias.
#        After this command executes, you can copy the PMD output to your clipboard and paste it in your PMD code.

#  Examples:

#   Show all data sources
# datasources:list

#  Show fields in Course_Subjects - 11e0a81730fa10001163b640941b2663
#  datasources:fields 11e0a81730fa10001163b640941b2663

#  Query specific fields within Course_Subjects with query command:
#
#  datasources:query SELECT Name, Inactive, Abbreviation, Course_Subject FROM Course_Subjects
#  WHERE Abbreviation = 'BIOL'
#  LIMIT 50

#  Can also query with standalone query command:
#
#  SELECT Name, Inactive, Abbreviation, Course_Subject FROM Course_Subjects
#  WHERE Abbreviation = 'BIOL'
#  LIMIT 50

#  Variable Example:
#   - PMD expressions can be entered as shown below. The query will be run as written
#   - The PMD expression will replace everything on the right side of the line with the expression on the left
# ${myAbbreviation.expression} = 'BIOL'
